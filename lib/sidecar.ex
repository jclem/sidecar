  Runs sidecar processes with Elixir apps

  Sidecar's goal is to serve the common need for running sidecar processes
  alongside an Elixir application. For example, one might need to run an
  [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) proxy alongside their Phoenix application in
  order to test incoming webhook URLs.

  One way of solving this problem is by using a tool like
  [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman), but using this tool isn't
  always desirable. Sidecar allows a developer to specify sidecar processes
  that run as part of their application's supervision tree, instead.

  In order to use Sidecar, first specify a set of processes to run:

  ```elixir
  config :sidecar, processes: [
    ngrok: "ngrok http 4000"
  ]
  ```

  Then, add Sidecar.Supervisor to your app's supervision tree:

  ```elixir
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # ...etc.
      Sidecar.Supervisor
    ]
  end
  ```

  Note that sidecar processes can also be specified in the child spec:

  ```elixir
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # ...etc.
      {Sidecar.Supervisor, [processes: [ngrok: "ngrok http 4000"]]}
    ]
  end
  ```

  ## Defining Commands

  Process commands can be defined in multiple ways:

  - As a string: `"echo hello"`â€”the command will be split on whitespace.
  - As a list of strings: `["echo", "hello"]`
  - As a function returning a string or a list of strings: `fn -> ["echo", "hello"] end`

  See `t:Sidecar.Process.command/0` for details.
